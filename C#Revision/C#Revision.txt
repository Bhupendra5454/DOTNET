------------
1)Readonly - readonly can be initialized either at declaration or within a constructor,readonly fields are useful when you have data that should not change after initialization.
  const - const must be initialized at declaration,value cannot be changed once initialized eg(PI)

2)this keyword - this keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class,
                 it is particularly useful in scenarios like constructor chaining, accessing instance members, and extension methods.

3)Constructor chaining - Constructor chaining in C# refers to the technique where one constructor can call another constructor within the same class.
                         This allows constructors to reuse initialization logic and avoid code duplication, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

4)Extension Method - Extension method can be implemented by Passing object as (this Object obj1) as Paramater to method of differnt class(Class 2)
                     that you want to use in original calss(Class 1).

5)Object initializers - Object initializers let you assign values to any accessible fields or properties of an object,
                        at creation time without having to invoke a constructor followed by lines of assignment statements.

6)Indexer - Indexers are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to treat instances of a class like arrays or collections. 

7)Singleton - (Singleton is an design pattern that ensurs tha only single instance is created for a class)
              Only one object is created and shared with another functions throughout application execution.
 
8)Static veriable - A variable shared across all instances of a class, initialized once and accessible using the class name rather than instances. 

9)Instance veriable -  Each instance of a class has its own set of variables, initialized when the object is created and accessed using the instance of the class.

10)Ref , out - ref passes parameters by reference, allowing modifications to affect the original variable; out designates output parameters,
               useful for returning multiple values from a method.

11)Out of scope,in scope -  Refers to whether a variable or entity is accessible within a specific block of code (in scope) or not (out of scope),
                            based on its declaration and the current execution context.

12)Inheritance - Inheritance in object-oriented programming allows one class (subclass/derived class) to inherit behaviors and properties from another class (superclass/base class),
                 promoting code reuse and hierarchical organization of classes.

13)Polymorphism - Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
                  It allows methods to be defined in multiple forms, facilitating flexibility and the ability to implement methods specific to each class.
 
14)Shadowing - Shadowing in C# involves a subclass hiding a superclass member with the same name using the new keyword,
               contrary to polymorphism where method overriding with override ensures subclass-specific implementations are invoked through superclass references.
 
15)Concrete class - A concrete class is a regular class that can be instantiated to create objects.
                    It provides complete implementation for all its methods and does not contain any abstract methods.

16)Abstract class - An abstract class cannot be instantiated on its own; it serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from.
                    It may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that subclasses must implement.

17)Interface - An interface in C# defines a contract of methods, properties, events, or indexers that implementing classes must provide.
               It enables multiple inheritance and promotes loose coupling by allowing unrelated classes to implement the same set of behaviors.

18)What is design pattern - Design patterns in C# are standardized solutions to common problems in software design.
                            They represent best practices and reusable templates that help developers solve recurring design challenges efficiently.

19)Why Design pattern - Standardized Solutions, Common Vocabulary, Code Reusability, Scalability and Maintainability, Performance Optimization

20)Advantages of design pattern - Proven Solutions, Saves Time, Improves Code Quality, Encourages Best Practices.

(Design PAttern)
21)Singleton -  Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

22)Factory - A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

23)Observer - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

24)IClonable - An interface that enables objects to be cloned. It allows creating a copy of an existing object without explicitly using its constructor.

25)IComparable - This interface is typically implemented by a class when you want instances of that class to be able to compare themselves with other instances of the same class.
                 It provides a natural ordering for objects. The CompareTo method, which is part of IComparable, returns an integer indicating whether the current object is less than,
                 equal to, or greater than the other object.

26)IComparer - This interface is used to define a separate class for comparing instances of a particular type.
               It allows you to create custom comparison logic without modifying the classes being compared.
               The IComparer interface defines a Compare method that compares two objects of the same type and returns an integer indicating their relative order. 

27)JaggedArray -  A jagged array (also known as an array of arrays) is an array whose elements are arrays themselves.
                  Each element (subarray) can have different lengths.

28)Assembly - A logical unit that contains compiled code (IL code), metadata, and resources needed for an application to execute.
              It is the smallest unit of deployment in .NET.

29)Assembly loader - A component responsible for loading assemblies into the application domain at runtime, resolving dependencies, and ensuring they are available for execution.

30)Code verifier - Part of the .NET runtime that checks the IL (Intermediate Language) code for type safety and other security concerns before it is compiled into native machine code.

31)Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler - Converts IL code into native machine code that the processor can execute directly, improving performance by compiling code on demand at runtime.

32)Garbage collector - Automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, freeing developers from manually deallocating memory and reducing memory leaks.

33)Process - An instance of a program that is being executed by the operating system, which includes its own memory space, resources, and execution environment.

34)Primary Thread - Also known as the main thread, it is the initial thread created when a process starts and where the program's entry point begins execution.

35)Worker Thread - A thread created by the application explicitly to perform background tasks concurrently with the primary thread, often used to improve responsiveness and efficiency.

36)Daemon thread - A background thread that runs continuously in the background without user intervention, typically used for tasks such as garbage collection or monitoring.

37)CLR (Common Language Runtime) - The core component of the .NET Framework and .NET Core that manages memory, thread execution,
                                   code execution, security, and other runtime services required by managed code.

38)Assembly Consists of - Various components that collectively define an assembly's structure and content, including the PE Header, CLR Header, Manifest, Metadata, IL code, and Resources.

39)PE Header - Stands for Portable Executable Header, which is a standard file header for executable files and DLLs on Windows operating systems,
               providing information about the structure and properties of the file.

40)CLR Header - Contains information specific to the Common Language Runtime (CLR),
                such as the version of the CLR required to execute the assembly and any special permissions needed.

41)Manifest - A crucial part of an assembly that includes metadata about the assembly itself, such as its version, culture,
              strong name (if signed), and a list of all files within the assembly, including modules and resources.

42)Metadata - Contains descriptive information about the types, members, and references within the assembly,
              enabling runtime environments and tools to understand and interact with the code without executing it.

43)IL Code - Stands for Intermediate Language Code, which is the platform-independent, high-level language that .NET compilers generate from source code.
             It is executed by the CLR's JIT compiler to produce native machine code.

44)Resources - Optional files embedded within the assembly that can include images, icons, localized strings, configuration files,
               and other data used by the application at runtime.

45)Reflection - A feature in .NET that allows code to inspect and manipulate the structure, types, and members of assemblies at runtime.
               It enables dynamic loading of assemblies, invoking methods, and accessing properties without knowing them at compile time.

46)Decompilation - The process of converting executable (compiled) code, such as IL (Intermediate Language) in .NET or machine code in other languages, back into human-readable source code.
                   It is often used for reverse engineering or understanding how a program works without access to the original source code.

47)ILDASM - ILDASM (IL Disassembler) is a utility provided by the .NET Framework SDK
           (Software Development Kit) and Visual Studio that allows developers to view the IL (Intermediate Language) code of .NET assemblies.

Garbage Collection -
------------------
48)Managed Heap - When you create a new object in C#, it is allocated on the managed heap. The runtime takes care of allocating space for this object and keeping track of it.

49)Generational Garbage Collection : It divides objects into three generations based on their age, optimizing performance by frequently collecting younger objects and less frequently collecting older ones.
                                     This approach minimizes the overhead of garbage collection by focusing on short-lived objects.

50)Finalization - Finalization in C# is the process by which an object can perform cleanup operations before it is reclaimed by the garbage collector.
                  It is implemented using a Finalize method, which is automatically called by the garbage collector before the object’s memory is deallocated.
                  This allows for the release of unmanaged resources, although it's generally recommended to use the IDisposable interface for more predictable resource management.

51)Finalize Method - Objects in .NET Core can define a special method called Finalize.
                     This method is automatically called by the Garbage Collector before an object is garbage collected.
                     The Finalize method is typically used to perform cleanup tasks, such as releasing unmanaged resources or closing handles.

52)Finalization Queue - When an object with a finalizer is created, a reference to it is placed in a special queue called the finalization queue.
                        The Garbage Collector maintains this queue to keep track of objects that need finalization.

53)Deterministic Finalization - Deterministic finalization uses the IDisposable interface to allow you to manually release resources with the Dispose method.
                                This way, resources are cleaned up when you decide, not just when the garbage collector runs.

54)IDisposable - IDisposable is an interface in C# that provides a mechanism for releasing unmanaged resources, such as file handles or database connections, in a deterministic manner.
                 Classes that implement IDisposable should override the Dispose method to free these resources explicitly.

55)Dispose Method - The Dispose() method is called explicitly by the developer when they no longer need the object or when it goes out of scope.

56)Indeterministic - In indeterministic finalization, the finalization process is handled automatically by the garbage collector, which runs at non-deterministic times.
                     Objects that require finalization but do not implement IDisposable rely on the garbage collector's finalization queue to perform cleanup.

57)GC.Collect() - Triggers an immediate garbage collection of all generations.
                  It forces the garbage collector to reclaim memory by removing objects that are no longer in use. Use this method cautiously,
                  as it can impact performance and is usually unnecessary in most scenarios where automatic garbage collection suffices.

58)GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers() - Blocks the current thread until the garbage collector has processed all finalizers for objects that have been marked for finalization.
                                   This ensures that finalization (cleanup of unmanaged resources) is completed before proceeding with further operations.

59)GC.SuppressFinalize(object obj) - Prevents the finalizer of the specified object from being called.
                                     This is useful when an object has already been cleaned up manually through its Dispose method,
                                     so there's no need for the finalizer to run. This helps improve performance by avoiding unnecessary finalization.
