<h1>Job Guarnette  Course Delusion</h1>

<div>
    <p>&#8220;Sir, can you suggest a Job Guarantee Course?&#8221;. </p>
    <p>Being a mentor and owner of Training company: Transflower; I do come across this question regularly from job seeking candidates. A job guarantee course refers to a training program that promises participants about employment upon completion of the program. Such courses or programs do exist in various forms. Now a days I do notice some courses have been mentioned as Job Assistance or Placement Assurance Courses. I personally feel it is important to evaluate their claims and understand the specifics before concluding their validity.</p>
    <p>There are some job guarantee courses offered by reputable educational institutions or organizations. These courses have been established in partnerships with employers. These courses are designed to provide participants with the skills and qualifications needed for specific industries. The goal of these courses is to bridge the skills gap and increase employability. These courses offer specialized training and connecting graduates with job opportunities.</p>
    <p>It is a great privilege to enjoy role as an instructor, faculty, teacher, Software Engg., IT consultant, Microsoft Certified Trainer, and mentor from 26 years. It&#8217;s amazing journey in Information Technology as a Corporate Trainer in Corporate world, Visting Faculty for Post Graduation Courses, Consultant for IT projects and now Chief Mentor in Transflower. I still remember myself as a student(fresher) in 1997 after passing out from Computer engineering acadmics. I would like to share my views, thoughts as well insight developed based on expereinces gained for those, who are evaluating a job guarantee course.</p>
    <p>Not all programs that make such promises deliver same. Sometimes they may be misleading or fraudulent. It&#8217;s always recommended to students as well as parents to do research about such courses, their reputation as well as track record before enrolling. Look for reviews, testimonials from previous participants. Explore available data on employment outcomes.</p>
    <p>Do consider the following factors:</p>
    <p><strong>1.Credibility:</strong></p>
    <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li>Research the reputation and credibility of the institution or organization offering the course.</li>
       <li>Look for accreditation, partnerships with reputable employers, and success stories from past participants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2.Program Structure:</strong></p>


    <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li>Assess the curriculum and training methods offered in the course.</li>
        <li>Does it provide comprehensive and up-to-date training in relevant skills?</li>
        <li>Are there opportunities for hands-on experience or internships?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3.Employer Connections:</strong></p>
     <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li>Investigate the course&#8217;s network of employers and industry partners.</li>
        <li>Verify the strength of their relationships and the extent to which they actively recruit graduates from the program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>4.Employment Statistics:</strong></p>
     <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li>Request information on the program&#8217;s job placement rates and the types of jobs graduates typically secure.</li>
        <li>Transparent reporting of employment outcomes is an essential indicator of a program&#8217;s effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>5.Fine Print:</strong></p>
    <ul class="wp-block-list">
        <li>Carefully read the terms and conditions of any job guarantee offered.</li>
        <li>Understand the criteria that need to be met to qualify for the guarantee, such as maintaining a certain GPA (Grade Point Average), completing all coursework, or meeting specific job application requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One thing I would like to emphasis for students who are seeking for such job guarantee or assurance courses that <strong>success ultimately depends on your individual effort, dedication, and market conditions</strong>. While such programs can enhance your skills and increase the likelihood of finding employment, they do not guarantee a job without any effort on your part.</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Job Gurantte is a delusion without your efforts, dedication, and market condition.</strong></span></p>
    <p>Learn to build skill, not to just demand a Job.  I could recall one famous dialog from 3-Idiots Bollywood Movie. </p>
    <p>&#8220;<strong>Success Ke Peeche Mat Bhaago, Excellence Ka Peecha Karo, Success Jhak Maarke Tumhare Peeche Ayegi.</strong>&#8220;</p>
    <p>&#8220;<strong>Job Ke Peeche Mat Bhaago, Excellence Ka Peecha Karo, Job Jhak Maarke Tumhare Peeche Ayega</strong>.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Skill First Approach; not Job First Approach.</p>
    <p>The future belongs to skills mastery, not degrees. Apprenticeships/Internships and alternative pathways tailored to required skills are on the rise.</p>
    <p>The college degree&#8217;s dominance as the ticket to professional jobs is ending. With skills gaps urgencies, degrees often misaligned with workplace needs, and college costs soaring, more employers now hire based on skills assessments.</p>
    <p>We have success stories to share. It is always an honour to play a catalyst role in your learning curve.</p>
    <p>Tap your potential.</p>
